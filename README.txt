My LineShifter Project has 6 classes: a SoundEffect, Piece, GUI, Game, Comp and Board class

This project introduced me to implementing algorithms to play games with my Comp class

The game is played using the Game, Piece, and Board classes

The GUI and SoundEffect classes display the game

The Comp class implements the algorithm so the computer can play the game
